## For Internal Contributors

* Follow trunk workflow(https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)
* Branch naming -> `{type}/TICKET_ID/description`
  * Where type = `feat` / `feature` / `fix` / `chore` / `doc` / `release`
* Always recive PR review approvals
* Rebase your branch with main, wait for CI to pass
* Squash merge your commit
  * Follow the following template for both PR description and squashing to main
  * Use imperative language in title and description
  * The template is very similar to conventional commits. [Read More](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Template

// Section: PR description. Optional!

Add a brief description of the changes that you have involved in this PR
Bullet points are also fine
Good to wrap at 120 chars, no problems if its longer, this is not dogma

// Section: Footer. Recommended!
// Recommended! if you are dealing with SB_ISSUES(Customer issues) or release tickets
Fixes: [<TICKET_ID>](https://sendbird.atlassian.net/browse/<TICKET_ID>)
